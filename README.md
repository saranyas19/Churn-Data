# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn**—the likelihood of a customer leaving a telecom service provider. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model helps telecom companies identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention actions.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information such as:

* Account Length
* Area Code
* International Plan
* Voice Mail Plan
* Call Minutes (Day, Evening, Night, International)
* Number of Calls
* Total Charges
* Target Variable: **Churn (Yes/No)**

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Handling Missing Values & Outliers
* Encoding Categorical Variables
* Feature Scaling
* Class Imbalance Handling using SMOTE
* Model Building: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
* Model Evaluation: F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall Curve

## 🚀 Results

The model showed **high recall**, meaning it was particularly good at identifying customers who are likely to churn, helping reduce revenue loss.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost

## ✅ Conclusion

By accurately identifying churners, telecom companies can retain valuable customers, optimize customer service, and increase profitability.
